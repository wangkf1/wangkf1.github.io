I should have done this a long time ago, but here it is anyways: A list of books I read in 2018, with summaries and thoughts so that I don't forget.

### Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimension - Edwin A. Abbott

Flatland was published in 1884, nearly a century and a half ago. A short, 82-page story, Flatland depicts life of a two-dimensional world. In this world lives two-dimensional creatures: lines, triangles, squares, pentagons, and so on. Whether or not it is satire, the society of Flatland bears close resemblance to Victorian England. Women are lines, one-dimensional, and are the lowliest of shapes. Men and their families' social statuses are determined at birth by the number of sides they have. The religious elite and highest class of beings are those with the highest number of sides, such that they resemble circles.

But in the rest of the book, Abbott goes more into the mathematical side of the story. Through the point of view of the narrator, A. Square, who is a square, Abbott explains the physical nature of the world. The shapes see each other as lines (imagine lowering your eyes to the level of a table surface and looking at paper-thin shapes). A. Square then dreamed of a pitiful one-dimensional society called Lineland where people can only see things as a single point, and where he is only perceived by them as a single line as well. He is later visited by a three-dimensional sphere, who shows him the three-dimensional world and how A. Square's society is limited in their perception.

Flatland seems to have been written in a time before multi-dimensionality was a common concept in mathematics. Yet Abbott explains multidimensional very well, in plain and intuitive diagrams and with the analogy of Flatland. In terms of spatial dimensions, there is no way for a 2-D being to visualize and travel the 3-D world without help from a 3-D being. The same goes for 3-D beings with 4 dimensions, which the sphere in the story rejects as a possibility.

For me, the story was the perfect length. It was just short enough to explain the concept of multiple dimensions, and just long enough to stimulate many more questions. For example, what about four dimensions? Could our world really be inhabiting a four-dimensional space, yet we just cannot possibly perceive it? If time counts as a dimension, then do we really experience a four-dimensional world, even if we can only travel one direction along time? Looking past the Victorian-era language and social satire, this book goes over a fundamental topic in mathematics in a way that anybody can understand, and even geek out over.

A sequel does exist, Flatterland written in 2001, that goes over many of those concepts. I am currently reading it, but am a little overwhelmed by the amount of mathematics compared to this book (also because I read it on the bus, not at a desk).

### Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Davis Graeber

This book is about debt. You heard that correctly, debt. Very long and dense, the book goes into the relationship of debt and human society. A seemingly modern invention, debt has been around for longer than coins have been around. It is intricately involved in so many aspects of human life beyond economics, such as marriage, friendship, law, religion, and war. The book presents a history of debt and its various forms.

The first fundamental point Graeber makes is that debt precedes money and barter. The common story of a society starting out with barter, then moving on to money, and finally credit and debt, is not only unsupported by evidence, but is likely to be reversed. Frequently, small societies long ago relied on credit and debt established off of proximity and relationships. After a while, dealing with strangers and larger societies meant foregoing the relational aspects and transitioning trade to a form less dependent on trust.

The second point he makes is that whenever standing armies were used, coinage and taxation came along with it to create markets and fund the army. To incentivize subjects to fund armies, soldiers were given coins to spend, and subjects were taxed on those coins. Since the only way to pay the taxes were with the coins, people provided services to the soldiers, and subsequently creating markets with currency.

The final point is that throughout all of this, debt was and still is intertwined with our moral thinking. Every religion and philosophy has a delicate balance of shaming both the debtor that ruined people and also the indebted for failing to keep his promise to repay. Our idea of forgiving debts only extends to certain groups of people and not others. Debt and credit is almost built into our way of thinking around many aspects of life.

I enjoyed this book. It provided lots of interesting history and anthropology on my favorite topics: economics and philosphy. But it was incredibly long and dense and I found myself skimming sections of it. I have tried re-reading it but could not get to the halfway mark. I would recommend this book as a one-time read to someone that enjoys the topic.
