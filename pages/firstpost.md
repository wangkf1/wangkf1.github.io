# First post

Here's the first post. I have a few reasons for creating this site:

* I have many thoughts about many things, and I either write them down in random places or forget them. Keeping them in a central place makes things organized.
* I learn many things throughout work, church, home, and from friends. Writing them down means I can review my notes.
* I read books and forget what they're about. I plan on starting to write book outlines, summaries, and reviews.
* I do not regularly write for my job (besides code and documentation), so I intend to also improve my writing skills with this.

Hopefully I can stick to it this time around and regularly write things down here. Even if no one reads these, this is a way to make it "public" and force myself to be consistent. Call it a "new year's resolution" that I started mid-February.
